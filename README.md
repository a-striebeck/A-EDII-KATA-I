# A-EDII-KATA-I
Programming Paradigms on C++ and Python

## What is a coding Kata?

A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each.
The intent behind code kata is similar. Each is a short exercise (perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long). Some involve programming, and can be coded in many different ways.
